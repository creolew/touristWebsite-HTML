			<h2>Sawfish hot pot Hoang Minh</h2>
			<address>
				Address: 40 Truong Cong Dinh street, Vung Tau City
			</address>
			<p>This spot serves the best stingray hot pot in town, a local folk dish thought to carry a great deal of nutrition. The hot pot comes with many different ingredients in addition to stingray – pickled bamboo, chili, vermicelli, rice crackers, a side plate of herbs and of course, the ubiquitous fish sauce that you can’t get away from in Vietnam. Make sure you don’t go alone as it will take at least two people to finish.</p>

			<h2>Khot cake Goc vu sua</h2>
			<address>
				Address: 14 Nguyen Truong To street, Vung Tau City
			</address>
			<p>Mini pancake is another one of Vung Tau’s specialties, often chosen over the popular banh xeo. Khot cake Goc Vu sua is a local favorite that’s become increasingly popular with foreigners, drawn inside by the sounds of sizzling pancake batter and the delicious smells. When you eat, take advantage of all the condiments – the greens, the shredded papaya, and sauce. Get a tall glass of sugar cane juice to go with, too.</p>

			<h2>Long Son Floating Village</h2>
			<address>
				Address: Tan Thanh district, Vung Tau City

			<p>Long Son Floating Village is a wooden ‘floating’ house, resting on stilts above the water. The concept, style, and location does a great job of creating a peaceful atmosphere as you dine.
